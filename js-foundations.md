# Javascript Foundations Assessments

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. List the data types in Javascript. Indicate which are primitives.
        
  

     Obeject-- made up of behaviors & data          

     Primitive Data Types: 
        Boolean-- true or false
        Null-- no value
        Undefined-- a declared variable, but hasn't been given a value
        Number-- integers, floats, etc.
        String-- an array of characters 
        Symbol-- a unique value that's not equal to any other value

2. What's the difference between =, ==, and === in JavaScript?

    ===  Strict equality- both type & value have to be the same
    
    
    ==   Loose equality- two values are compared only after attempting to
                        convert them into a common type.
                        
    =    Assignment operator- assigns two values
    

3. What is the difference between an array's index and length?

    An array's length sets or returns the number of elements in an array
    
    An array's index is the specified position in an array

    Statement 1: where the loop starts

    Statement 3: increases or decreases a value each time the code block 
                is looped

5. What is a function's declaration, argument, and call?

    Declaration- defines a function with an argument
